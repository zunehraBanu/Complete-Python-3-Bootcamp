# Variable Assignment in Python

# Dynamic Typing Example
my_dogs = 2
print(my_dogs)

my_dogs = ['Sammy', 'Frankie']
print(my_dogs)

# Assigning Variables
a = 5
print(a)

a = 10
print(a)

# Using variables in expressions
print(a + a)

# Reassigning variables
a = a + 10
print(a)

# Shortcut assignment operators
a += 10
print(a)

a *= 2
print(a)

# Determining variable type
print(type(a))

a = (1, 2)
print(type(a))

# Simple Exercise
my_income = 100
tax_rate = 0.1
my_taxes = my_income * tax_rate
print(my_taxes)
